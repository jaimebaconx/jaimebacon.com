  <h1>YouTube doesn&#39;t let you categorize your subs... so I fixed it.</h1>
  <p class="post__date">January 1, 2026</p>
  <p>If you’re like me, your YouTube subscriptions are just one giant, impossible-to-navigate list. Gaming channels, tutorials, news, creators you actually care about — it’s all mixed together. There’s no folders, no categories, nothing to make sense of it. And that’s insane.</p>
<p>So I decided to fix it. Using a combination of <a href="https://www.notion.com/">Notion</a>, <a href="https://www.make.com/">Make.com</a>, and <a href="https://takeout.google.com/">Google Takeout</a>, I built a workflow to organize subscriptions into meaningful categories.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Export your subscriptions</h3>
<p>Google Takeout lets you download all your YouTube data, including the list of channels you’re subscribed to. This gives you a structured CSV you can import anywhere. I'll have to
explore Google Takeout more, until today, I didn't even know it existed.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Import into Notion</h3>
<p>Once you have your CSV, you can import it into Notion as a database. Now you have rows for every channel, which you can tag, categorize, and even filter by type of content or interest.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Automate with Make</h3>
<p>To keep the database updated automatically, I built a Make.com scenario that periodically syncs new subscriptions from YouTube into Notion. No more manual updates. Your categorized list stays current.</p>
<h3>Why this matters</h3>
<p>This isn’t just a convenience hack — it’s a way to actually make YouTube usable when you follow dozens or hundreds of creators. It’s also an example of how combining no-code tools with a little ingenuity can solve everyday frustrations.</p>
<p>I’m planning to make this workflow available for anyone who wants it — and I’ll document it in detail in future posts. Stay tuned if you want to reclaim your subscriptions.</p>
